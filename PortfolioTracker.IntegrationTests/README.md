# PortfolioTracker.IntegrationTests

This project contains **integration tests** for the PortfolioTracker application.

## Purpose

Integration tests verify that multiple components of the application work together as expected. In this project, integration tests primarily target the API controllers and test the application's behavior through HTTP requests, simulating real-world usage.

## What is tested?

- API endpoints (controllers)
- End-to-end scenarios involving the web application, database, and infrastructure

## Notes

- These tests may use in-memory or containerized databases.
- Ensure all dependencies are available before running the tests.
